There may be some\r\nhiccups.\r\n\r\nIntro\r\n-----\r\nThe goal of this problem is to provide a quick-to-use and easily generalizable\r\nimplementation of the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm....\r\n* ***Quick-to-use:*** At its core, one only needs to provide the set of obstervations,\r\nthe system which obtained those observations, and the type of signal prior. However,\r\n`ample` contains a number of options to allow the user to tailor AMP to suit their\r\nparticular needs.\r\n* ***Generalizable:*** `ample` provides a framework by which the user can easily \r\nimplement their own priors to fit AMP to their specific application.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n----------------\r\nMany thanks to Jean Barbier and Andre Manoel for their moment and update calculations\r\nfor the supplied priors.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
